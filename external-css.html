            <p class="blog">What kind of bucket list doesn’t include the Great Pyramids of Giza in Egypt? Believe it or not, the Giza pyramids are fairly easy to visit on a day trip from Cairo, the capital of Egypt.
      
              Built in 2560 BC, the Great Pyramid of Giza was the tallest man-made object in the world for 3,800 years. It’s the oldest of the Seven Wonders Of The Ancient World, and the only one still standing today.
              
              Visiting the Egypt pyramids is a pretty simple experience, and there’s not a whole lot to do there except gaze at the big piles of rock, but it’s still a profound and unique experience that every traveler should check off their list.
              
              This travel guide will explain how you can visit the Egyptian pyramids on your own, with or without a tour, and with a very modest budget and minimal planning!</p>
